                            The 2023 holiday season was, I think, a key turning point in my life. No, I didn’t discover the true meaning of Christmas — I discovered <a href="https://www.scrimba.com">Scrimba</a>. With a few weeks off work, I capitalized on the opportunity to really throw myself headfirst into web development. Scrimba quickly became my favourite resource.

                            Like many people, I came to Scrimba by way of freeCodeCamp. Their fun-first, hands-on approach appealed to me, but it actually wasn’t quite love at first sight. I found the UI a little clunky and didn’t immediately take to the scrim format. Writing this now, that feels like blasphemy! It wasn’t until I delved into JavaScript that I developed an appreciation for it. Scrimba’s interactive screencasts are one of a kind — undoubtedly, one of the most effective means of teaching web development.

                            But Scrimba is more than that. The most valuable gift Scrimba Claus gave to me is motivation. I had a rocky start transitioning from HTML and CSS to JavaScript. The way programming is taught is often complex, obtuse, and dry. Scrimba showed me that it doesn’t always have to be that way. I was struggling hard, to the point I was doubting I’d ever be able to learn programming. Per’s Intro to JS course was like a lifeguard yanking me out of a riptide. It felt like coding on easy mode — but not only that, the lessons are lighthearted, you get to learn via fun projects, and it really emphasizes all the small victories along the way.

                            On New Year’s Eve, I decided to sign up for Scrimba Pro. Now, entering into my fourth month on the <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend">Frontend Developer Career Path</a>, I’m so glad I did. It’s the best $175 I’ve ever spent.
