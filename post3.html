                        <p>
                            Memory retention has been a constant struggle for me over the past 5 to 10 years. I believe I can thank mental illness for that. I forget so many things — deadlines, important emails to send, science facts, and even precious memories with my loved ones. If you start a sentence with, “Do you remember when…,” chances are I’ll say no (and feel really, really shitty about it). My Swiss cheese memory was a big concern for me as I set out to study web development. I doubted I’d even remember a third of the material.                            
                            <br><br>
                            Then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvey9g0VgY0">a YouTube video</a> that changed the way I learn. “I’m kind of creating an exterior brain,” Ryan Holliday says, showing off his system of categorized index cards. He has read over 3000 books and is able to remember the best parts of all of them, because whenever he reads something that is impactful in some way, he copies it onto an index card.                            
                            <br><br>
                            So I thought, “If my brain can’t retain information, I just need to build my own exterior brain.” Like a catalogue of books or an external hard drive full of data, I would have access to every concept I’d learned, whether or not the wrinkly pink meat in my head wanted to hold on to it.

                            Rather than index cards, my medium of choice is Notion. Right from the start, I resolved to write EVERYTHING I learned into my Notion docs. And I do mean EVERYTHING. Each time I learn something new, even the smallest things, I take notes or copy the instructions and pop them into my Notion. Then I rewrite them in my own words, and in many cases, come up with my own examples to illustrate the concept.
                            <br><br>
                            I’m so glad I did. Sure, I’m as forgetful as always, but now I know exactly where to look. Rather than waste time hunting for answers on MDN Docs or StackOverflow, I can go straight into a well-organized directory containing every single fact I’ve learned, already explained for me in the style my mind processes best. It really is my external brain. I’m now a collector of knowledge, and despite my memory struggles, now I can take heart knowing that nothing is ever TRULY forgotten.
