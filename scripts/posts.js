    When I was 10 years old, my family had a computer in the living room equipped with the latest and greatest technology: a dial-up modem. My siblings and I would bicker over whose turn it was to play computer games, and of course, everything ground to a halt whenever Mom had an important phone call to make. Regardless, all three of us kids got very, very deep into Neopets. In my case, so deep that it led me to my future career.

    Neopets had forum boards where you could chat with other players — whether that was to buy and sell in-game items, to discuss strategies for beating the hardest mini-games, or just to talk about whatever was interesting to a bunch of geeky kids in the early 2000s. On those boards, users could customize their profiles and posts using HTML, and even make little “webpages.” 

    The internet in the age of AOL and Myspace was not at all interested in minimalism. You’ve probably seen the blindingly bright and charmingly chaotic “vintage” websites from that era. Now imagine what you got when none of the web designers were older than 12. There were a minimum of 6 colours and 3 fonts on each page. Things sparkled and wiggled and scrolled. There was music that played as soon as you opened a page (and good luck trying to turn it off). There was word art, clip art, and Angelfire.com. Layouts had to be jury-rigged by stuffing your entire page into an HTML <table> element. In short, it was a wondrous playground I immersed myself in, all in the name of having the coolest Neopets profile ever.

    When I got involved with Scrimba’s student community, I discovered I was not the only ‘90s kid who fell in love with HTML by way of Neopets. Micha, one of the bootcamp mentors, described it as “the Neopets to developer pipeline.” I think that’s both hilarious and weirdly apt. As Neopets prepares to celebrate its 25th anniversary next year, we can look back on it fondly as the gateway drug to coding for hundreds (or perhaps even thousands) of millennial developers.

    `I was in my second year of college when I realized the thing I was doing now was not the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

    I jumped straight from high school to George Brown College, studying graphic design. At the time, I loved design, and I was great at it. That started to change as I slogged my way through college — but then in my third semester, I walked into Web Design I and fell head over heels. The primary focuses of that class were UX and responsive design, but we were taught just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous. 

    Graphic designers are artsy types, not analytical types. While my classmates languished through our coding lessons, I was thriving. My professor became one of the best mentors I’ve had in my entire life (shout out to Ms. Hill, Mr. Moskal, and Guy Matorin!). Web design became my niche in the world of graphic design.

    But it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Although web design was a little bright spot, graphic design school in general was killing me. Throughout college, I placed extremely high standards on myself in terms of the quality of my designs. I encountered almost-daily roadblocks — and failed several courses — because my motivation would plummet if I felt my work-in-progress was ugly. If it wasn’t absolutely perfect from step 1, I couldn’t stand to look at it. I’m sure you can see how counterproductive that was.

    I was slipping deep into depression, and my own mind became a hostile environment to me. Mental illness convinced me that I hadn’t only disappointed myself, but that everybody else — my family, my peers, my teachers — was disappointed in me, too. I wanted to put graphic design behind me, but I felt compelled to stick it out to the bitter end. After all, if I dropped out now, the toxic thoughts and feelings of being an utter failure might have followed me through the rest of my life.

    I dragged myself through the rest of college, got my advanced diploma, and heaved a sigh of relief: “Thank god I don’t have to do graphic design anymore.” I was beyond burnt out. While I tried to figure out what the fuck I was going to do with my life next, I avoided thinking about anything to do with graphic design. Sadly, that included the websites I had so enjoyed creating. 

    Then this past December, something clicked for me. I decided to try web development instead of web design. As soon as I started studying code, I was hooked. The passion I had boxed up and shoved away in a dark corner of my psyche was suddenly reignited. 

    I feel so liberated doing web development. I can focus on coding and the delight of building things without being weighed down by the burden of making everything look perfect. It’s been such an incredible journey and I’m so glad I gave coding another chance. I think this is where I was meant to be. I feel so much more confidence and optimism for my future. And now, when I make things pretty, it’s not because I have to — it’s simply because I want to.

    Like so many other self-taught developers, my learning journey began with freeCodeCamp. It’s one of the most well-known sites out there — and it’s, well, free. It’s a great place to start.

    I found the lessons in the Responsive Design module easy to follow, and the projects provided just the right level of difficulty. The things I completed for freeCodeCamp truly felt like my own creations, and I was particularly proud of two of them. On my Survey Form, I challenged myself to incorporate every kind of HTML <input>, just so I could get familiar with them all. Then when I started my third project, the Technical Documentation Page, I chose the topic I was having the most difficulty with at the time: obscure CSS selectors. They say the best way to learn is by teaching. By pretending I was explaining CSS selectors to someone else, I was really teaching myself. And it worked!

    I put a lot of effort into those projects. Too much effort, I realized, as I blew through a third hour of agonizing over the design of my Personal Portfolio Webpage project. I had an epiphany: no matter how “perfect” I try to make this, in 6 months’ time I’ll have learned so much that my first projects will look like my childhood finger paintings. My philosophy shifted from “I must build the best thing I possibly can” to “I’m going to build this as a draft version that I can come back to and improve later.”

    By the time I finished fCC’s responsive design curriculum, I felt confident that I was steering my life in a very promising direction. Sure, that module was super basic stuff — “baby’s first code” — but those basics provided the foundation for me and so many other aspiring web developers. The freeCodeCamp contributors have dedicated their personal time and energy to teaching others. I think that is such a powerful and beautiful thing to do. Thanks for being there, freeCodeCamp!

    Memory retention has been a constant struggle for me over the past 5 to 10 years. I believe I can thank mental illness for that. I forget so many things — deadlines, important emails to send, science facts, and even precious memories with my loved ones. If you start a sentence with, “Do you remember when…,” chances are I’ll say no (and feel really, really shitty about it). My Swiss cheese memory was a big concern for me as I set out to study web development. I doubted I’d even remember a third of the material.

    Then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvey9g0VgY0">a YouTube video</a> that changed the way I learn. “I’m kind of creating an exterior brain,” Ryan Holliday says, showing off his system of categorized index cards. He has read over 3000 books and is able to remember the best parts of all of them, because whenever he reads something that is impactful in some way, he copies it onto an index card.

    So I thought, “If my brain can’t retain information, I just need to build my own exterior brain.” Like a catalogue of books or an external hard drive full of data, I would have access to every concept I’d learned, whether or not the wrinkly pink meat in my head wanted to hold on to it.

    Rather than index cards, my medium of choice is Notion. Right from the start, I resolved to write EVERYTHING I learned into my Notion docs. And I do mean EVERYTHING. Each time I learn something new, even the smallest things, I take notes or copy the instructions and pop them into my Notion. Then I rewrite them in my own words, and in many cases, come up with my own examples to illustrate the concept.

    I’m so glad I did. Sure, I’m as forgetful as always, but now I know exactly where to look. Rather than waste time hunting for answers on MDN Docs or StackOverflow, I can go straight into a well-organized directory containing every single fact I’ve learned, already explained for me in the style my mind processes best. It really is my external brain. I’m now a collector of knowledge, and despite my memory struggles, now I can take heart knowing that nothing is ever TRULY forgotten.
