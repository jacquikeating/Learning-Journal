                        <p>
                            I was in my second year of college when I realized the thing I was doing now was not the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
                            <br></br>
                            I jumped straight from high school to George Brown College, studying graphic design. At the time, I loved design, and I was great at it. That started to change as I slogged my way through college — but then in my third semester, I walked into Web Design I and fell head over heels. The primary focuses of that class were UX and responsive design, but we were taught just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous. 
                            <br></br>
                            Graphic designers are artsy types, not analytical types. While my classmates languished through our coding lessons, I was thriving. My professor became one of the best mentors I’ve had in my entire life (shout out to Ms. Hill, Mr. Moskal, and Guy Matorin!). Web design became my niche in the world of graphic design.
                            <br></br>
                            But it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Although web design was a little bright spot, graphic design school in general was killing me. Throughout college, I placed extremely high standards on myself in terms of the quality of my designs. I encountered almost-daily roadblocks — and failed several courses — because my motivation would plummet if I felt my work-in-progress was ugly. If it wasn’t absolutely perfect from step 1, I couldn’t stand to look at it. I’m sure you can see how counterproductive that was.
                            <br></br> 
                            I was slipping deep into depression, and my own mind became a hostile environment to me. Mental illness convinced me that I hadn’t only disappointed myself, but that everybody else — my family, my peers, my teachers — was disappointed in me, too. I wanted to put graphic design behind me, but I felt compelled to stick it out to the bitter end. After all, if I dropped out now, the toxic thoughts and feelings of being an utter failure might have followed me through the rest of my life.
                            <br></br>                            
                            I dragged myself through the rest of college, got my advanced diploma, and heaved a sigh of relief: “Thank god I don’t have to do graphic design anymore.” I was beyond burnt out. While I tried to figure out what the fuck I was going to do with my life next, I avoided thinking about anything to do with graphic design. Sadly, that included the websites I had so enjoyed creating. 
                            <br></br>
                            Then this past December, something clicked for me. I decided to try web development instead of web design. As soon as I started studying code, I was hooked. The passion I had boxed up and shoved away in a dark corner of my psyche was suddenly reignited. 
                            <br></br>
                            I feel so liberated doing web development. I can focus on coding and the delight of building things without being weighed down by the burden of making everything look perfect. It’s been such an incredible journey and I’m so glad I gave coding another chance. I think this is where I was meant to be. I feel so much more confidence and optimism for my future. And now, when I make things pretty, it’s not because I have to — it’s simply because I want to.
