                            Like so many other self-taught developers, my learning journey began with freeCodeCamp. It’s one of the most well-known sites out there — and it’s, well, free. It’s a great place to start.
                            <br><br>
                            I found the lessons in the Responsive Design module easy to follow, and the projects provided just the right level of difficulty. The things I completed for freeCodeCamp truly felt like my own creations, and I was particularly proud of two of them. On my Survey Form, I challenged myself to incorporate every kind of HTML, just so I could get familiar with them all. Then when I started my third project, the Technical Documentation Page, I chose the topic I was having the most difficulty with at the time: obscure CSS selectors. They say the best way to learn is by teaching. By pretending I was explaining CSS selectors to someone else, I was really teaching myself. And it worked!

                        <p>
                            I put a lot of effort into those projects. Too much effort, I realized, as I blew through a third hour of agonizing over the design of my Personal Portfolio Webpage project. I had an epiphany: no matter how “perfect” I try to make this, in 6 months’ time I’ll have learned so much that my first projects will look like my childhood finger paintings. My philosophy shifted from “I must build the best thing I possibly can” to “I’m going to build this as a draft version that I can come back to and improve later.”
                            <br><br>
                            By the time I finished fCC’s responsive design curriculum, I felt confident that I was steering my life in a very promising direction. Sure, that module was super basic stuff — “baby’s first code” — but those basics provided the foundation for me and so many other aspiring web developers. The freeCodeCamp contributors have dedicated their personal time and energy to teaching others. I think that is such a powerful and beautiful thing to do. Thanks for being there, freeCodeCamp!
